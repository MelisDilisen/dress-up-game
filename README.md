# DRESS UP GAME

## Introduction

This is a game project that I’ve done as part of a 3-person group project in 2019. The drawings are all done by me. The game is a simple dress up game containing 3 different female characters.
The aim of the game is to encourage creative thinking in children by putting on dresses to the characters with various clothing combinations to their own liking. The project is implemented in JavaScript.

## Game Rules and Features

The user is expected to first click on the ‘Characters’ button to open up the character option. Then, the user can select any hair, shirt, pant, shoe combination along with the background option. Background option allows the user to see its character in three different types of background and context.

In this dressing up game, there is also a “How do I look?” option, giving the user randomized feedbacks on her looks.
